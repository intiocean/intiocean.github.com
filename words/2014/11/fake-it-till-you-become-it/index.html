<div class="entry-content"><p>There is a moving and insprirational TED talk about body language at the end of which Amy Cuddy says</p>
<blockquote><p>I want to say to you, don&#8217;t fake it till you make it. Fake it till you become it.</p></blockquote>

<p>To give you a little more context here is the run up to that quote.</p>

<blockquote><p>I worked and worked and worked, and I got lucky, and worked, and got lucky, and worked. Eventually I graduated from college. It took me four years longer than my peers, and I convinced someone, my angel advisor, Susan Fiske, to take me on, and so I ended up at Princeton, and I was like, I am not supposed to be here. I am an impostor. And the night before my first-year talk, and the first-year talk at Princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people. That&#8217;s it. I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m quitting.&#8221; She was like, &#8220;You are not quitting, because I took a gamble on you, and you&#8217;re staying. You&#8217;re going to stay, and this is what you&#8217;re going to do. You are going to fake it. You&#8217;re going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do. You&#8217;re just going to do it and do it and do it, even if you&#8217;re terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience, until you have this moment where you say, &#8216;Oh my gosh, I&#8217;m doing it. Like, I have become this. I am actually doing this.&#8217;&#8221; So that&#8217;s what I did. Five years in grad school, a few years, you know, I&#8217;m at Northwestern, I moved to Harvard, I&#8217;m at Harvard, I&#8217;m not really thinking about it anymore, but for a long time I had been thinking, &#8220;Not supposed to be here. Not supposed to be here.&#8221;</p><p>So at the end of my first year at Harvard, a student who had not talked in class the entire semester, who I had said, &#8220;Look, you&#8217;ve gotta participate or else you&#8217;re going to fail,&#8221; came into my office. I really didn&#8217;t know her at all. And she said, she came in totally defeated, and she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not supposed to be here.&#8221; And that was the moment for me. Because two things happened. One was that I realized, oh my gosh, I don&#8217;t feel like that anymore. You know. I don&#8217;t feel that anymore, but she does, and I get that feeling. And the second was, she is supposed to be here! Like, she can fake it, she can become it. So I was like, &#8220;Yes, you are! You are supposed to be here!</p><p>She comes back to me months later, and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it, she had actually faked it till she became it. So she had changed. And so I want to say to you, don&#8217;t fake it till you make it. Fake it till you become it. You know? It&#8217;s not â€” Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize.</p><footer><strong>Amy Cuddy 2012</strong> <cite><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are">Your Body Language Shapes Who You Are</a></cite></footer></blockquote>
