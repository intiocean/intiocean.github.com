    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a moving and insprirational TED talk about body language at the end of which Amy Cuddy says
<blockquote><p>I want to say to you, don’t fake it till you make it. Fake it till you become it.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>To give you a little more context here is the run up to that quote.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>I worked and worked and worked, and I got lucky, and worked, and got lucky, and worked. Eventually I graduated from college. It took me four years longer than my peers, and I convinced someone, my angel advisor, Susan Fiske, to take me on, and so I ended up at Princeton, and I was like, I am not supposed to be here. I am an impostor. And the night before my first-year talk, and the first-year talk at Princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people. That’s it. I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and said, “I’m quitting.” She was like, “You are not quitting, because I took a gamble on you, and you’re staying. You’re going to stay, and this is what you’re going to do. You are going to fake it. You’re going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do. You’re just going to do it and do it and do it, even if you’re terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience, until you have this moment where you say, ‘Oh my gosh, I’m doing it. Like, I have become this. I am actually doing this.’” So that’s what I did. Five years in grad school, a few years, you know, I’m at Northwestern, I moved to Harvard, I’m at Harvard, I’m not really thinking about it anymore, but for a long time I had been thinking, “Not supposed to be here. Not supposed to be here.”</p></p><p><p>So at the end of my first year at Harvard, a student who had not talked in class the entire semester, who I had said, “Look, you’ve gotta participate or else you’re going to fail,” came into my office. I really didn’t know her at all. And she said, she came in totally defeated, and she said, “I’m not supposed to be here.” And that was the moment for me. Because two things happened. One was that I realized, oh my gosh, I don’t feel like that anymore. You know. I don’t feel that anymore, but she does, and I get that feeling. And the second was, she is supposed to be here! Like, she can fake it, she can become it. So I was like, “Yes, you are! You are supposed to be here!</p></p><p><p>She comes back to me months later, and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it, she had actually faked it till she became it. So she had changed. And so I want to say to you, don’t fake it till you make it. Fake it till you become it. You know? It’s not — Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize.</p><footer><strong>Amy Cuddy 2012</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are'>Your Body Language Shapes Who You Are</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A quote which made me smile today.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>C is a very nice high level language with many of the modern programming constructs in it. The thing thats very important about it is that it lets you avoid the details of the machine when you want to, but when you need to, and sometimes when you’re writing an operating system you really do need to, you can get at the details of the machine and control everything. But you’re not forced to do that and thats important because that means you can write operating systems in this language and still have something that can be portable to other machines.</p><footer><strong>John R. Mashey 1982</strong> <cite><a href='http://youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0'>The UNIX Operating System</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A quote from end of a really great presentation titled “<a href="http://vimeo.com/22746156">The Top 10 Things I Wish I Knew When I Graduated College</a>” by Debbie Millman at the February Creative Mornings in New York.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>If you think that you’re too busy to do something. I wanna talk to you about what busy means. I think busy is a four letter word. I think busy is never about busy in the sane way that sex is not about sex and money is never about money.</p></p><p><p>Busy is a way of organising your priorities and we use being busy or thinking that we’re busy as a reason not to do something that we <em>really want to do</em>. If you’re not doing something that you really want to do then you really don’t want to do it. If you really want to do something, you will find the time to do it. Be honest with yourself. If you’re not doing something that you tell yourself that you want to be doing it means that you don’t want to be doing it. Figure out either how to do it or what to do instead.</p></p><p><p>Ultimately I think it’s important to consider the two ways of living. You can live out of fear where everything in front of you is something that is unnerving or you can live out of power where everything could be an opportunity if you let it. So I think, in order to strive for a remarkable life, you have to decide that you want one. Because if you expect less, less is all you’re going to get.</p></p><p><p>I hope that the force be with you and I thank you for your time and for coming out in this miserable weather.</p></p><p><p>Thank you very, very, very, very much.</p></blockquote></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few quotes from an interview of Mirko Ilic by Debbie Millman on the Design Matters podcast. You will have to listen to the podcast to hear his great accent (link to podcast in title).</p>

<p>When asked why he didn’t want to work at the New York Times Op-Ed pages for the rest of his life
<blockquote><p>If you stay too long on one place, become routine, and then you can forget, even those beautiful brilliant moments on the beginning, becomes job…</p></blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote><p>I stopped doing comics because I got bored with my own comics…<br/>… you must entertain yourself in the first place</p></blockquote></p>

<p>“So Mirko, you love to experiment?”
<blockquote><p>Exactly. And really, business wise, its extremely bad because once, when you start doing something well you just need to cash in. And just do it many of those. But is boring. And I didn’t become artist to be bored by myself. If is boring to me how boring must be to people who consume that?!</p></blockquote></p>
