    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A quote which made me smile today.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>C is a very nice high level language with many of the modern programming constructs in it. The thing thats very important about it is that it lets you avoid the details of the machine when you want to, but when you need to, and sometimes when you’re writing an operating system you really do need to, you can get at the details of the machine and control everything. But you’re not forced to do that and thats important because that means you can write operating systems in this language and still have something that can be portable to other machines.</p><footer><strong>John R. Mashey 1982</strong> <cite><a href='http://youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0'>The UNIX Operating System</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A quote from end of a really great presentation titled “<a href="http://vimeo.com/22746156">The Top 10 Things I Wish I Knew When I Graduated College</a>” by Debbie Millman at the February Creative Mornings in New York.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>If you think that you’re too busy to do something. I wanna talk to you about what busy means. I think busy is a four letter word. I think busy is never about busy in the sane way that sex is not about sex and money is never about money.</p></p><p><p>Busy is a way of organising your priorities and we use being busy or thinking that we’re busy as a reason not to do something that we <em>really want to do</em>. If you’re not doing something that you really want to do then you really don’t want to do it. If you really want to do something, you will find the time to do it. Be honest with yourself. If you’re not doing something that you tell yourself that you want to be doing it means that you don’t want to be doing it. Figure out either how to do it or what to do instead.</p></p><p><p>Ultimately I think it’s important to consider the two ways of living. You can live out of fear where everything in front of you is something that is unnerving or you can live out of power where everything could be an opportunity if you let it. So I think, in order to strive for a remarkable life, you have to decide that you want one. Because if you expect less, less is all you’re going to get.</p></p><p><p>I hope that the force be with you and I thank you for your time and for coming out in this miserable weather.</p></p><p><p>Thank you very, very, very, very much.</p></blockquote></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few quotes from an interview of Mirko Ilic by Debbie Millman on the Design Matters podcast. You will have to listen to the podcast to hear his great accent (link to podcast in title).</p>

<p>When asked why he didn’t want to work at the New York Times Op-Ed pages for the rest of his life
<blockquote><p>If you stay too long on one place, become routine, and then you can forget, even those beautiful brilliant moments on the beginning, becomes job…</p></blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote><p>I stopped doing comics because I got bored with my own comics…<br/>… you must entertain yourself in the first place</p></blockquote></p>

<p>“So Mirko, you love to experiment?”
<blockquote><p>Exactly. And really, business wise, its extremely bad because once, when you start doing something well you just need to cash in. And just do it many of those. But is boring. And I didn’t become artist to be bored by myself. If is boring to me how boring must be to people who consume that?!</p></blockquote></p>

    <id>http://intiocean.com/words/2012/02/considering-the-next-larger-context-quote</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><blockquote><p>Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context - a chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an environment, an environment in a city plan.</p><footer><strong>Eliel Saarinen</strong> <cite>Growing Object-Oriented Software</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>I’m reading Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided By Tests and found this quote in it. I would recommend this book to any developer, I’m learning much from it and I’ve only read five chapters so far!</p>
