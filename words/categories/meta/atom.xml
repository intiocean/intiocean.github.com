    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m trying out <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a>. </p>

<p>As you may or may not have noticed depending on how long after this post was written you are reading this, I have decided to use <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a>. If it happens that you are reading this as the second most recent post it is likely that my most recent post is about a different blogging framework which I have decided to use! ;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been contemplating redesigning my website. Recently however wordpress updated and now there is a new default theme which comes with it (twenty eleven). I rather like this new theme and can’t convince myself (yet) if I still should redesign…</p>

<p>Does anyone have any thoughts on the matter?</p>

<p>I would like to redesign it so that it doesn’t look like the stock wordpress theme but should I?</p>
