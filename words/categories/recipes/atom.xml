    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Ingredients: (for 2)</h2>

<h3>For the rice:</h3>

<ul>
<li>A little oil (personally I like sunflower oil for this)</li>
<li>1 large Clove of Garlic (Crushed)</li>
<li>1 cup of Basmati Rice (You may not need this much - I do love rice)</li>
<li>1.5 cups of Water</li>
<li>salt to taste (~1/3 tsb)</li>
</ul>


<h3>For the Beans:</h3>

<ul>
<li>A little oil</li>
<li>1 medium onion (chopped)</li>
<li>1/2 tsb Cumin Seeds</li>
<li>~15 Cherry Tomatoes</li>
<li>1 tin of Butter Beans</li>
<li>1 tbsp Vegetable Stock</li>
<li>1/2 cup of Water</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
<li>Yogurt (Personally I like greek yogurt but any plain yogurt will do)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Recipe:</h2>

<h3>For the rice:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Boil some water</li>
<li>Heat the oil and add the crushed garlic and stir</li>
<li>Once the garlic is golden (this will be very quick) add the water and the salt</li>
<li>Add the rice and cover</li>
<li>Once it starts boiling turn down the heat as low as possible and leave to cook for ~20 minutes. After 20 minutes taste the rice to see if it is cooked. If the water dries up before the rice is cooked then add a small amount more. Note: you want the water to dry up completely at the same time as the rice becomes cooked!</li>
</ul>


<h3>For the Beans:</h3>

<p>Once the rice is on start the beans.</p>

<ul>
<li>Heat the oil and add the chopped onion</li>
<li>Let the onion simmer stirring occasionally until golden</li>
<li>Add the cumin seeds and stir for 30 seconds or so</li>
<li>Add the cherry tomatoes (whole!)</li>
<li>Drain and rinse the tin of butter beans and then add to the pot.</li>
<li>Add a little water (~1/2 a cup)</li>
<li>Add the vegetable stock and salt</li>
<li>Leave to cook on a medium heat stirring occasionally until the cherry tomatoes have exploded and made the beans tasty.</li>
</ul>


<p>Hopefully by now the rice is just about done and you can eat it :)
Serve with the yogurt which although you might not think would go that well with the tomatoey beans it works a treat.
Enjoy!<br/>
Note:Â The measurements might be a tad off as I usually measure to eye.</p>
