    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/content/20111128-miso.jpg" alt="Miso Soup" /></p>

<h2>Ingredients (for 3):</h2>

<ul>
<li>A little vegetable oil (I use sunflower)</li>
<li>A teaspoon of sesame oil</li>
<li>2 Celery sticks</li>
<li>1 Carrot</li>
<li>1 Head of broccoli</li>
<li>Miso paste</li>
<li>Ginger</li>
<li>Sesame seeds</li>
<li>A dash of tabasco or tiny bit of chili in some other form</li>
</ul>


<h2>Recipe:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Slice the celery thinly so you get moon shaped slices.</li>
<li>Peel and slice the carrot into half centimetre circles.</li>
<li>Put some vegetable oil and the sesame oil in a large saucepan.</li>
<li>Once the oil is hot, drop in the celery and carrot and saute for 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Separate the broccoli into florets and add to the pan.</li>
<li>let it all saute for a few more minutes while stirring regularly to ensure all the brocoli gets mixed in.</li>
<li>slice some ginger as thin as you can and add to the pan. I would say 5 or so thin slices should do it.</li>
<li>Boil some water separately in an electric kettle and then add it to the pan. About half a liter of water, enough to generously cover the rest of the vegetables.</li>
<li> Add Miso paste to taste. 2-3 tablespoons should do the trick.</li>
<li>Turn the soup off and toast some sesame seeds to sprinkle on top.</li>
<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Ingredients: (for 2)</h2>

<h3>For the rice:</h3>

<ul>
<li>A little oil (personally I like sunflower oil for this)</li>
<li>1 large Clove of Garlic (Crushed)</li>
<li>1 cup of Basmati Rice (You may not need this much - I do love rice)</li>
<li>1.5 cups of Water</li>
<li>salt to taste (~1/3 tsb)</li>
</ul>


<h3>For the Beans:</h3>

<ul>
<li>A little oil</li>
<li>1 medium onion (chopped)</li>
<li>1/2 tsb Cumin Seeds</li>
<li>~15 Cherry Tomatoes</li>
<li>1 tin of Butter Beans</li>
<li>1 tbsp Vegetable Stock</li>
<li>1/2 cup of Water</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
<li>Yogurt (Personally I like greek yogurt but any plain yogurt will do)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Recipe:</h2>

<h3>For the rice:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Boil some water</li>
<li>Heat the oil and add the crushed garlic and stir</li>
<li>Once the garlic is golden (this will be very quick) add the water and the salt</li>
<li>Add the rice and cover</li>
<li>Once it starts boiling turn down the heat as low as possible and leave to cook for ~20 minutes. After 20 minutes taste the rice to see if it is cooked. If the water dries up before the rice is cooked then add a small amount more. Note: you want the water to dry up completely at the same time as the rice becomes cooked!</li>
</ul>


<h3>For the Beans:</h3>

<p>Once the rice is on start the beans.</p>

<ul>
<li>Heat the oil and add the chopped onion</li>
<li>Let the onion simmer stirring occasionally until golden</li>
<li>Add the cumin seeds and stir for 30 seconds or so</li>
<li>Add the cherry tomatoes (whole!)</li>
<li>Drain and rinse the tin of butter beans and then add to the pot.</li>
<li>Add a little water (~1/2 a cup)</li>
<li>Add the vegetable stock and salt</li>
<li>Leave to cook on a medium heat stirring occasionally until the cherry tomatoes have exploded and made the beans tasty.</li>
</ul>


<p>Hopefully by now the rice is just about done and you can eat it :)
Serve with the yogurt which although you might not think would go that well with the tomatoey beans it works a treat.
Enjoy!<br/>
Note: The measurements might be a tad off as I usually measure to eye.</p>
