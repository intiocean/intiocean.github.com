  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was having a coffee today at my local coffee shop and I had a moment of inspiration and scribbled over both sides of an index card. This is more or less what I wrote.</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>The necessity of having to take something from start to end is stopping me being as productive/creative/happy as I could be. In order to improve this I need to accept that it’s okay to pick some work up, take it forward a little and then let it lie or let someone else continue it. Because even though when considered from a top down view this doesn’t seem the most efficient way of doing things, it allows one to do what <em>really</em> interests us without constantly feeling guilty of all the things we have not completed. Instead of feeling guilty, we should feel proud of the work we have done even if we didn’t take the work over the finish line we have still helped it along the way.</p>

<p>What does it mean to have completed something [a piece of work] in this age of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker">knowledge workers</a>? There are more knowledge workers than ever before and this makes me think that we can’t hold on to the same definition of <em>complete</em> that we all currently have. I think we need a new notion of complete, a more agile notion and one which conveys that complete just means complete for me, complete for now. Not necessarily complete forever or for everyone.</p>

<p>When is a software package or library complete? At the first release, second, tenth? When it’s decommissioned?</p>

<blockquote><p>Release early, release often.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A quote from end of a really great presentation titled “<a href="http://vimeo.com/22746156">The Top 10 Things I Wish I Knew When I Graduated College</a>” by Debbie Millman at the February Creative Mornings in New York.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you think that you&#8217;re too busy to do something. I wanna talk to you about what busy means. I think busy is a four letter word. I think busy is never about busy in the sane way that sex is not about sex and money is never about money.</p><p>Busy is a way of organising your priorities and we use being busy or thinking that we’re busy as a reason not to do something that we *really want to do*. If you’re not doing something that you really want to do then you really don’t want to do it. If you really want to do something, you will find the time to do it. Be honest with yourself. If you’re not doing something that you tell yourself that you want to be doing it means that you don’t want to be doing it. Figure out either how to do it or what to do instead.</p><p>Ultimately I think it’s important to consider the two ways of living. You can live out of fear where everything in front of you is something that is unnerving or you can live out of power where everything could be an opportunity if you let it. So I think, in order to strive for a remarkable life, you have to decide that you want one. Because if you expect less, less is all you’re going to get.</p><p>I hope that the force be with you and I thank you for your time and for coming out in this miserable weather.</p><p>Thank you very, very, very, very much.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few quotes from an interview of Mirko Ilic by Debbie Millman on the Design Matters podcast. You will have to listen to the podcast to hear his great accent (link to podcast in title).</p>

<p>When asked why he didn’t want to work at the New York Times Op-Ed pages for the rest of his life</p>
<blockquote><p>If you stay too long on one place, become routine, and then you can forget, even those beautiful brilliant moments on the beginning, becomes job&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I stopped doing comics because I got bored with my own comics&#8230;<br />&#8230; you must entertain yourself in the first place</p></blockquote>

<p>“So Mirko, you love to experiment?”</p>
<blockquote><p>Exactly. And really, business wise, its extremely bad because once, when you start doing something well you just need to cash in. And just do it many of those. But is boring. And I didn&#8217;t become artist to be bored by myself. If is boring to me how boring must be to people who consume that?!</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was reading an article about becoming a designer and some of the points resonated with me. (via <a href="http://hackdesign.org">hack design</a>)</p>

<blockquote><p>Tip #3: Design everything you do</p><p>&#8230;Your emails should be written/composed clearly and beautifully. Your conversations with individuals should be designed through how you listen, how you maintain eye contact, how you respond (both spoken and unspoken). Everything you do should have a reason, no matter how small. Design requires constant practice, this is a great way to keep growing.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don’t think its possible to design <em>everything</em> but if we keep design in the back of our minds at all times we are more likely to be able to spot problems and design great solutions for them.</p>

<blockquote><p>Tip #7: Focus on defining and solving problems</p><p>A lot of the work you see at design showcase websites are great examples of well executed decorations that lack substance. The people that can perform this type of work are countless and the skills highly commoditized. Avoid pixel-pushing at all costs – your job is to solve problems. View your work through that lens at all times. Always know what problems you are trying to solve while in the process of designing (e.g., people are having a hard time knowing where to go next in a flow, or, the current visual design does not reflect the mood of our brand). Good designers solve problems, great ones ensure they are solving the right ones. Accurately defining the problem goes a long way towards solving it.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a no brainer but its something which I don’t often think about.</p>

<p>I often see stunning designs and don’t stop to consider what solution they are actually solving (if any) before wishing my designs were as polished. This then leads me down the road of never releasing anything because it isn’t as nice as said design.</p>

<p>The reason this tip resonated with me was that I constantly need to remind myself the importance of of solving a problem rather than creating something beautiful which may not actually achieve what I want. Writing this down it seems so damned obvious but its something I often forget.</p>

<p>As you may or may not have noticed depending on how long after this post was written you are reading this, I have decided to use <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a>. If it happens that you are reading this as the second most recent post it is likely that my most recent post is about a different blogging framework which I have decided to use! ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Below are a few of my favorite blogs which I follow.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://daringfireball.net/">daring fireball</a> is a apple centric blog although John Gruber also writes about other businesses occasionally though usually in comparison with apple. This is a great blog for apple news.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/">swiss miss</a> is a swiss designers blog. Tina Roth Eisenberg lives in NYC and reblogs cool and interesting designs. One thing I especially like about this blog is that it is centered around images with a few words accompanying each image.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/">farnam street</a> is a blog which have recently started following but it deserves a mention as most things I have read from it have been interesting and thought provoking.</li>
  <li>I used to enjoy following <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">lifehacker</a> but these days I find its just too busy and much of what they post is not interesting to me so I have set up a huge list of filters using yahoo pipes which narrows down the amount I get from here. I’ve been thinking of giving up reading lifehacker though as I rarely find anything interesting on it any more. (if you are interested I have posted a screenshot and link to my filter at the bottom of this post.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly one other thing you should check out for some inspiration, although its not exactly a blog; by which of course I mean its not a blog, is <a href="http://www.creativemornings.com/">creative mornings</a>. Creative mornings is a series of morning talks aimed at creative types which happen all over the world. I have found the New York ones to be especially good.</p>

<p>I think everyone should follow some blogs on topics they are interested as I find they can provide: Information, News, Thought provoking material, New ideas, Inspiration, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</p>

<p>If you don’t know about <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=rss">rss</a> then you should find out about it. I’m sure many people have written very good explanations on what it is and how to use it so I won’t bore you with the details.</p>

<p>The only thing I will say is investigate <a href="http://reader.google.com">google reader</a>. I use google reader to keep my list of rss feeds and manage what I have read but I don’t usually read my feeds directly though it. There are many applications written which sync with google reader and provide a nicer reading experience. The app which I use (and personally love) is <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a> which is available for Mac OSX and iOS on the mac/ios app stores respectively.</p>

<p>For those of you who have no idea what an rss reader is, the following is an easy way to think about it. An rss reader is much like an email client only for blog posts rather than emails. You chose to follow the blog posts of a particular site and then any new blog posts by the site are sent to your rss reader as new unread items which you can then read at your leisure. The difference with a mail client and an rss reader is that read items in your rss reader are not kept.</p>

<p>Thats all for now.</p>

<p>Ciao!</p>

<p>My filters, as you can see, I filter a large number of terms

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/content/20111128-miso.jpg" alt="Miso Soup" />
##Ingredients (for 3):
- A little vegetable oil (I use sunflower)
- A teaspoon of sesame oil
- 2 Celery sticks
- 1 Carrot
- 1 Head of broccoli
- Miso paste
- Ginger
- Sesame seeds
- A dash of tabasco or tiny bit of chili in some other form</p>

<h2 id="recipe">Recipe:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Slice the celery thinly so you get moon shaped slices.</li>
  <li>Peel and slice the carrot into half centimetre circles.</li>
  <li>Put some vegetable oil and the sesame oil in a large saucepan.</li>
  <li>Once the oil is hot, drop in the celery and carrot and saute for 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Separate the broccoli into florets and add to the pan.</li>
  <li>let it all saute for a few more minutes while stirring regularly to ensure all the brocoli gets mixed in.</li>
  <li>slice some ginger as thin as you can and add to the pan. I would say 5 or so thin slices should do it.</li>
  <li>Boil some water separately in an electric kettle and then add it to the pan. About half a liter of water, enough to generously cover the rest of the vegetables.</li>
  <li> Add Miso paste to taste. 2-3 tablespoons should do the trick.</li>
  <li>Turn the soup off and toast some sesame seeds to sprinkle on top.</li>
  <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ul>
