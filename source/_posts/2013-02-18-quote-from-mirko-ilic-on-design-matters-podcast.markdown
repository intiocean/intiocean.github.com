A few quotes from an interview of Mirko Ilic by Debbie Millman on the Design Matters podcast. You will have to listen to the podcast to hear his great accent (link to podcast in title).

{% endblockquote %}

"So Mirko, you love to experiment?"

Exactly. And really, business wise, its extremely bad because once, when you start doing something well you just need to cash in. And just do it many of those. But is boring. And I didn't become artist to be bored by myself. If is boring to me how boring must be to people who consume that?!
{% endblockquote %}
