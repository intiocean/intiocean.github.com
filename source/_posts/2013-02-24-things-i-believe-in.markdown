I thought I would write a list of things which I believe in with a little explanation of each point.
{% blockquote %}Simplicity where possible{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}Communication is key{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}Thoughtful design{% endblockquote %}
{% blockquote %}Attention to detail in design (attention to detail is a term which is too overused leading it to not have much meaning, here I am talking about its most basic meaning){% endblockquote %}
