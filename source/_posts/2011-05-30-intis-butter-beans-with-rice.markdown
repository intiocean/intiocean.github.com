## Ingredients (for 2)

### For the rice
- A little oil (personally I like sunflower oil for this)  
- 1 large Clove of Garlic (Crushed)  
- 1 cup of Basmati Rice (You may not need this much - I do love rice)  
- 1.5 cups of Water  
- salt to taste (~1/3 tsb)  

### For the Beans
- A little oil  
- 1 medium onion (chopped)  
- 1/2 tsb Cumin Seeds  
- ~15 Cherry Tomatoes  
- 1 tin of Butter Beans  
- 1 tbsp Vegetable Stock  
- 1/2 cup of Water  
- salt to taste  
- Yogurt (Personally I like greek yogurt but any plain yogurt will do)  


## Recipe

### For the rice
  * Boil some water
  * Heat the oil and add the crushed garlic and stir
  * Once the garlic is golden (this will be very quick) add the water and the salt
  * Add the rice and cover
  * Once it starts boiling turn down the heat as low as possible and leave to cook for ~20 minutes. After 20 minutes taste the rice to see if it is cooked. If the water dries up before the rice is cooked then add a small amount more. Note: you want the water to dry up completely at the same time as the rice becomes cooked!


### For the Beans
Once the rice is on start the beans.

  * Heat the oil and add the chopped onion
  * Let the onion simmer stirring occasionally until golden
  * Add the cumin seeds and stir for 30 seconds or so
  * Add the cherry tomatoes (whole!)
  * Drain and rinse the tin of butter beans and then add to the pot.
  * Add a little water (~1/2 a cup)
  * Add the vegetable stock and salt
  * Leave to cook on a medium heat stirring occasionally until the cherry tomatoes have exploded and made the beans tasty.

Hopefully by now the rice is just about done and you can eat it :)
Serve with the yogurt which although you might not think would go that well with the tomatoey beans it works a treat.
Enjoy!  
Note:Â The measurements might be a tad off as I usually measure to eye.
