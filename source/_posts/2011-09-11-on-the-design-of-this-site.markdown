I have been contemplating redesigning my website. Recently however wordpress updated and now there is a new default theme which comes with it (twenty eleven). I rather like this new theme and can't convince myself (yet) if I still should redesign...

Does anyone have any thoughts on the matter?

I would like to redesign it so that it doesn't look like the stock wordpress theme but should I?
