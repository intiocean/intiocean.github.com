{% blockquote Steve Jobs, Macworld expo in San Fansisco January 7 1997 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhhFQ-3w5tE video %}
The line of code that a developer can write the fastest, the line of code that a developer can maintain the cheapest and the line of code that never breaks for the user is the line of code that the developer never had to write
{% endblockquote %}
