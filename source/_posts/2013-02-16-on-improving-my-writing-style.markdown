The way I have trained myself to write working in a busy office environment has been to include all the key facts in a form which allows them to be understood as quickly as possible. Reading articles and blog posts online I've come to realise that the most interesting reads are not written in this way but are instead written in a way which captures the intreast of the reader while also being infomative. Since I have become used to writing in a very specific way which is not very intersting to read I have decided I need to improve my writing style. To do so I will need to practice, practice, practice and then practice some more.

The question I am unsure about is to do with how I should go about practicing my writing. Should I write things for my own future consumption somewhere private (not online) or should I write blog style posts for my website? Also, if I write things for my website, should I pick a particular set of topics to write about or should I just write about anything which takes my intrest?

The reason this is an important question for me is twofold. On the one hand, I don't wish to be just another person generating terrible content which no one cares about. On the other hand, if I post my writings online then if I happen to write about something in which others are interested[^1] then my words will be available and easy to find for anyone looking, also I feel it's more likely I will receive helpful feedback if I post my work online.
