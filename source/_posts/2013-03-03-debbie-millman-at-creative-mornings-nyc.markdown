A quote from end of a really great presentation titled "[The Top 10 Things I Wish I Knew When I Graduated College](http://vimeo.com/22746156)" by Debbie Millman at the February Creative Mornings in New York.

{% blockquote %}
If you think that you're too busy to do something. I wanna talk to you about what busy means. I think busy is a four letter word. I think busy is never about busy in the sane way that sex is not about sex and money is never about money.

Busy is a way of organising your priorities and we use being busy or thinking that we’re busy as a reason not to do something that we *really want to do*. If you’re not doing something that you really want to do then you really don’t want to do it. If you really want to do something, you will find the time to do it. Be honest with yourself. If you’re not doing something that you tell yourself that you want to be doing it means that you don’t want to be doing it. Figure out either how to do it or what to do instead.

Ultimately I think it’s important to consider the two ways of living. You can live out of fear where everything in front of you is something that is unnerving or you can live out of power where everything could be an opportunity if you let it. So I think, in order to strive for a remarkable life, you have to decide that you want one. Because if you expect less, less is all you’re going to get.

I hope that the force be with you and I thank you for your time and for coming out in this miserable weather.

Thank you very, very, very, very much.
