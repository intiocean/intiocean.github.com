{% blockquote Eliel Saarinen, Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided By Tests %}
Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context - a chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an environment, an environment in a city plan.
{% endblockquote %}

I'm reading Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided By Tests and found this quote in it. I would recommend this book to any developer, I'm learning much from it and I've only read five chapters so far!
