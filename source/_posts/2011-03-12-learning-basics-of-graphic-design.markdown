I've wanted to learn the basics of graphic design for a long time. I even bought [The Graphic Design School](http://www.thamesandhudson.com/9780500285268.html) as I thought it would help me get on my way.

After letting it sit on the shelf for a long time and gather dust I have finally taken it down and plan to use it alongside the vast amount of resources available around the web. (I will link to some which I have found useful/interesting below.)



	
  * Lifehacker - [Learn the basics of Design](http://lifehacker.com/#!5739492/learn-the-basics-of-design-this-weekend)

	
  * [Meet Your Type](http://www.fontshop.com/education/) I found this to be a good introduction to typography. It gives an overview of its main aspects, although there is not much detail in the descriptions.

	
  * [Creative mornings](http://www.creativemornings.com) - A series of half hour talks given by designers about anything. I've been really enjoying these - I'm finding them inspirational and generally thought provoking.


I think the process of learning more about design in general is going to be a slow one but I'm glad I've made a start. I hope (and think) that it will prove to be a valuable skill to have as it can influence most of the choices I make thought my life. I will post more thoughts on design when they occur to me but for now I leave you with the following question which is a rephrasing of something I heard. _Do you think it is possible to design/make/produce anything that everybody really loves or is it a case of if no one hates it no one is likely to love it either?_
