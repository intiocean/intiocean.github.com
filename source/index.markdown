I'm a developer* with a strong interest in design & the web and a belief that good, thoughtful design makes a difference.

Born in a little village just outside Bath and brought up all over the world I love to travel! These days I spend most of my time in the tiny town of London.

This website will be a (rarely updated) collection of quotes, thoughts and images which inspire me.
