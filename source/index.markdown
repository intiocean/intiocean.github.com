Hi,

I'm a Quantitative Developer, Photographer and Designer who lives and works in London. My favorite time of day is dawn, although I don't often get up in time to see it.

My aim for this website is to collect links, thoughts and images that capture my interest. I also hope that it may be useful for me to refer back to in the future when I need to remind myself of how young and na&#239;ve I used to be, or am, or something...

If you want to know more about me you can find me around the web by running a web search for my name!

Thats all for now,

Inti
