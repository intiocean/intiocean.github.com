Hi,

I'm a Quantitative Developer, Photographer and Designer who lives and works in London. My favorite time of day is dawn although I don't often get up in time to see it.

My aim for this website is to collect links, thoughts and images that capture my interest so that I can refer back to them another day or maybe not until I'm old and gray.

If you want to know more about me you can find me around the web by running a web search for my name!

Thats all for now,
never forget to have fun!

Inti
